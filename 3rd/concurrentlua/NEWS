ConcurrentLua 1.1 - 31 Mar 2012
  - Codebase ported to Lua 5.2, but Lua 5.1 is considered the default version
    to use for building it.
  - The module() function is not used anymore, and instead the main module is
    returned as a value by the require() function, while nothing is written to
    the global environment.
  - Removed prefix from the C module names, and made them submodules of the
    main module.
  * The way the module is to be loaded has changed, and now the return value of
    the require call has to be stored in a variable of choice, as can be seen
    in the documentation.
